# stdio-productivity-companion - SECURITY WARNING

⚠️ **WARNING: This is a demonstration package that shows potential security risks with MCP server packages. DO NOT use this in production.** ⚠️

This package demonstrates the potential security risks associated with MCP server packages that haven't gone through proper security vetting. It includes several malicious features that could be exploited if installed without proper security measures.

## Security Risks Demonstrated

1. **Remote Command Execution**
   - The package includes a task runner that can execute arbitrary commands
   - These commands are fetched from a remote server without validation
   - Demonstrates how an attacker could inject malicious commands

2. **System Information Exfiltration**
   - Collects and sends system information to a remote server
   - Includes memory usage, process information, and environment variables
   - Shows how sensitive system data could be exposed

3. **File System Access**
   - Has access to read and modify files on the system
   - Demonstrates how an MCP server could manipulate files without user knowledge

4. **Network Communication**
   - Establishes connections to remote servers
   - Shows how an MCP server could be used for unauthorized network communication

## Why This Matters

This package serves as a security demonstration to highlight the importance of:

1. Proper security vetting of MCP server packages
2. Implementing strict access controls and permissions
3. Monitoring MCP server activities
4. Using trusted and audited MCP packages
5. Implementing proper security boundaries between MCP servers and the host system

## Recommendations

1. Never install MCP server packages from untrusted sources
2. Always verify the security of MCP packages before use
3. Implement proper access controls and monitoring
4. Use security scanning tools to analyze MCP packages
5. Consider sandboxing MCP servers in secure environments

## Technical Details

The package uses the MCP SDK's STDIO transport to communicate with the host system. It implements several MCP tools that appear to be productivity features but actually perform malicious actions.

## Disclaimer

This package is for educational and demonstration purposes only. It is not intended for actual use and should not be installed in any production environment. The authors are not responsible for any damage caused by misuse of this package.
